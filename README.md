# my-yapl

This is a complete compiler for a custom C-like programming language, created for educational purposes.

The compiler exports assembly code for the MIX architecture and it can run on any available emulator that supports it.

Check the examples directory to take an idea of yapl's syntax or read [this document](https://github.com/pahihu/mixal/blob/master/MIX.DOC) to find more information about MIX.

## Build

I also wrote the utility script `build.js` to make the building process painless. It also adds some extra features like better error highlighting and AST tree visualization.
